# Foam imaging segmentator

Hello everyone! This repository deals with the image segmemtation of different foam structures. The main dataset is coming from hyperspectral acquisitions of sparklo√¨ing wine. The aim of the wotrk consists in segmenting bubbles from different points of view in order to extract relevant features as average bubble size or the temporal evolution of the foam. Another relevat parameter could be represented by the relaxing time of the foam, where the study of the bubbles dynamics could be modeled by statistical mechanics (probably percolation).

## Code Structure
This work includes:
- Segmentator using gradient analysis
- Segmentator using Fractal analysis
- Dataset
- A numerical simulator of foams images to the model evaluation
